# TODO app

This project contains a simple TODO application
It has the following features -

- A user create TODO
- A user can see their existing TODOs
- A user can mark a TODO as done.

## Stetup

To setup this application, clone this repo into your system.

Then do `npm install` in frontend and backend folders

The backend is on the localhost:3000 rightnow.

Next I will be adding the adding the CSS and will try to add the signin/signout features in it.
